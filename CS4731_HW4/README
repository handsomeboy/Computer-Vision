Challenge 1b:



Formula

Assumption



Challege 2a:
To loadfocalstack takes about 1.25 seconds. 
In my tests, to generateIndexMap takes about ~95 seconds to run. I spoke to the TA who said it should take only a few minutes at the max, so this seemed reasonable to me. I added in disp statements so you can see that something is running. 
In total, runHw4('challenge2a') takes ~103 seconds, because it takes a little while to imwrite.

The MATLAB commands for directories/folders can differ for Windows/Mac.
I have a Mac (Unix-based) system (and so is Cunix/Clic) so the use of 
ls '-1s' works for me. It may be an issue if grading on Windows, so please grade on Clic/Cunix/Mac/another Unix machine. 

I didn't know if we were allowed to use imfilter(since in previous homeworks it was restricted), so I used loops as necessary.
Also I chose half_window_size to actually be the full window size, just because it was easier.
