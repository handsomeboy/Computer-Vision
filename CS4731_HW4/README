Challenge 1b:

Formula:
Given a point x_i, y_i in 2D space, we can find the corresponding point in 3D space:
z_s = sqrt( radius^2 - (x_i - x_center)^2 - (y_i - y_center)^2 )
where radius is the radius of the sphere and [x_center y_center] is the center of the sphere. This is a normal vector from the center of the sphere (assuming z-coordinate of center is zero) to the point in 3D space on the sphere.
This vector can be normalized (to a unit normal) by dividing each coordinate by the radius.
Summary: normal vector of unit length is:
n = < (x_i - x_center)/radius , (y_i - y_center)/radius, sqrt( radius^2 - (x_i - x_center)^2 - (y_i - y_center)^2 )/radius >

Assumption:
We can assume that the direction of the corresponding light source will be in the direction of the normal brightest surface spot because the surface is Lambertian. There are only diffuse peaks in the reflectance maps, so there are no specular components. So the 3D sphere will be brightest closest to the source, which is in the direction of the source (since the sphere is symmetric object), so that normal points in the direction of the source of light.


Challege 2a:
To loadfocalstack takes about 1.25 seconds. 
In my tests, to generateIndexMap takes about ~95 seconds to run. I spoke to the TA who said it should take only a few minutes at the max, so this seemed reasonable to me. I added in disp statements so you can see that something is running. 
In total, runHw4('challenge2a') takes ~103 seconds, because it takes a little while to imwrite.

The MATLAB commands for directories/folders can differ for Windows/Mac.
I have a Mac (Unix-based) system (and so is Cunix/Clic) so the use of 
ls '-1s' works for me. It may be an issue if grading on Windows, so please grade on Clic/Cunix/Mac/another Unix machine. 

I didn't know if we were allowed to use imfilter(since in previous homeworks it was restricted), so I used loops as necessary.
Also I chose half_window_size to actually be the full window size, just because it was easier.
