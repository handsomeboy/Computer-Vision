COMS4731: HW3

Fyi:

Sometimes, due to memory issues I think, runHw3('all') causes Matlab to crash. But if you run
runHw3('honesty')
runHw3('challenge1a')
runHw3('challenge1b')
runHw3('challenge1c')
runHw3('challenge1d')
runHw3('challenge1e')
runHw3('challenge1f')
it does not have an issue.

challenge1e is a little bit off, but mostly works
challenge1f produces building_panorama.png from f1.png, f2.png, f3.png, f4.png
